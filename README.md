# ru_practice
Tool to get declension tables for Russian nouns (and hopefuly some exercises in the future).

I started this project in the end of last year as a way to speed up my searches in wikitionary while also learning Rust (and GTK) along the way. I'm learning as I go, so the code is possibly very wrong in many many ways but it's at least currently working (except the practice window, that hasn't been done yet).
