# ru_practice
Tool to get declension tables for Russian nouns (and hopefuly some exercises in the future).

I started this project in the end of last year as a way to speed up my searches in wikitionary while also learning Rust (and GTK) along the way.

I'm learning as I go, so the code is possibly very wrong in many many ways but it's at least currently working (except the practice window, that hasn't been done yet), and that's basically why I put it here, as it may be useful for others to have a simple working example of the things I used (gtk-rs, calls to the wikipedia API, etc).
